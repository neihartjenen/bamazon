# Bamazon
For this project, I will be creating an app that acts like an Amazon storefront. I will be using MySQL to create my database and node to be able to run my application. This app will be able to take in customer orders and show the amount of inventory left as well as depleting stock when a customer decides to purchase. I will also be adding in a feature that can track sales across the different departments and provide a summary of the profits.
